# Programação Orientada à Objetos utilizando C#
> C# Interfaces with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles applied

## Motivation
The idea of this project was to apply concepts learned in class about C# and OOP using pratical examples
All the classes were categorized in 4 Stages with its related dificulty level and complexity

## Walkthrough
### Stage 1
The project started with an overview of the C# language, all using the command line application.
Simple programs were made to exemplify basic concepts, such as
- Class
- Object
- Methods
- Class construtor
- Avarage of two given numbers
- Rectangle area and dimensions


### Stage 2
Deeper OOP concepts were included in the project, programs were created to illustrate concepts such as
- Polimorfism
- Inheritance
- Aggregation
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

### Stage 3
Windows Form Application was introduced and OOP was applied to its construction
Basic programs, like avarage calculation, received an interface
More complex programs were created where Stage 2 concepts were included, such as
- Generic Stack
- Dynamic Stack
- Queue
- Singly Linked List 
- Doubly Linked List

### Stage 4
The idea of Exception Handling was introduced and applied in the previous programs
The following concepts were studied
- Try and Catch
- Finally
- User-Defined Exceptions
- Throwing Objects
- Error Handling using Interfaces blocks
